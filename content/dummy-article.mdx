Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has
been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex
custom CSS.

By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs,
headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building
application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when
you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text
editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us
things like:

> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I
> disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too? We hear
> you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you
> really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you
> use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want
> your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either â€” you want them to look
> _awesome_, not awful.

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you
_actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like
disabling our base styles.

It adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML
content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:

```html
<article className="prose">
	<h1>Garlic bread with cheese: What the science tells us</h1>
	<p>
		For years parents have espoused the health benefits of eating garlic bread
		with cheese to their children, with the food earning such an iconic status
		in our culture that kids will often dress up as warm, cheesy loaf for
		Halloween.
	</p>
	<p>
		But a recent study shows that the celebrated appetizer may be linked to a
		series of rabies cases springing up around the country.
	</p>
</article>
```

## What to expect from here on out

What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense I've written to
dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible typographic element I
could think of, like **bold text**, unordered lists, ordered lists, code blocks,
block quotes, _and even italics_.

It's important to cover all of these use cases for a few reasons:

1.  We want everything to look good out of the box.
2.  Really just the first reason, that's the whole point of the plugin.
3.  Here's a third pretend reason though a list with three items looks more
    realistic than a list with two items.

Now we're going to try out another header style.
